# GitHub Scavenger Hunt Challenge

Hi I am editing this in VIM, testing to see if this works.

1. Who created this GitHub repository?
2. How many different versions are stored (number of commits?)
3. Who is currently waiting for their changes to updated to the main code base?
4. When was this repository created?
